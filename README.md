# student-performance-analyzer
This project is created as part of the Python Code2Xplore – 60 Days Challenge (Day-3) by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM University–AP. It is a Student Performance Analyzer built using only basic Python lists, loops, strings, and conditional statements. The program classifies each mark as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, Fail, or Invalid, and also counts total valid and failed students. A personalization rule based on my name length adjusts marks (+2 for odd length, –2 for even), applied only to valid scores. The program follows all constraints with no built-in shortcuts.
